#we need an epsilon because floating point arithmetic is not exact
#if item <= free_space[bin_index]
#can fail even if the values should be equal mathematically â€” 
#due to tiny rounding errors like 0.29999999999999993 instead of 0.3

#An epsilon (EPS) is a tiny number (like 1e-11) 
#that you use to allow a small margin of error in comparisons:

#items: the items to assign to the bins
# 	assignment: the assignment of the ith item to the jth bin for all i items.
# 	            bin numbers start from 0.
# 	            assume len(assignment) == len(items).
# 	            you should not add any new elements to this list.
# 	            you must modify this list's elements to indicate the assignment.
# 	            see comment below for first-fit decreasing and for best-fit decreasing.
#
# 	free_space: the amount of space left in the jth bin for all j bins created by the algorithm.
# 	            you should add one element for each bin that the algorithm creates.
# 	            when the function returns, this should indicate the final free space available in each bin.
